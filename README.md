# SustainWorld: Guardians of the Enchanted Wilds

This project is a Fantasy Adventures RPG-themed gamified sustainability task tracker.

To enjoy this RPG, you need the user id from Section A with more than zero point. Hence, firstly you need to finish some tasks from Section A and then you can start playing this RPG.

## Getting Started
* First, create a character if u still doesn't has one. ***(Character Name and email must be unique!)***
* Go to profile page, by tapping Account actions at top right corner.
* You may edit your name to new one (must be unique) by pressing "Edit Name" Button in the screen center.
* Check your character's stats and info
* Quest Logs might be empty if you haven't done any
* Click Leaderboard to see characters ranked by level
* You may click a character to see a more detailed profile of a character
* You can click Global Chat to access messaging with other characters
* You may send messages and you can also edit and deleted you already sent
### Now It's time to do quests.
* Press quest, and u will see start quest button.
* The result will be shown after clicking that button.

### Inventory
* Click inventory to see ur items
* You may equip and unequip items that u have earned as rewards

## Game Play
Since there are a couple of validators or filters, you need to go steps by steps in this RPG.

What I mean is when u startly create your new character, all your character has is ***level 1 and a starter item: A normal sword which offers very low stats***.

Each quest has their own level requirement to be completed so **You can't just directly go fight a final bosss or high-level quest**.

You need to finish easier quests first to earn levels to unlock quest and after every quest, u will receive a unique item as reward which offer different stats (Example: an item offers 450 hp and 715 dmg which will be added to your character).

The result of a fight with a creature depends on hp and dmg of your character. So grind and earn levels and items first.
### Items need to be equipped to apply the stats to your character after receiving as rewards

Here's the gudiline for your gameplay.
* Create Character
* Finish the easiest quests
* Equip the items you earned as rewards
* Finish the other quests and equip reward items
* Slain the final boss and save the earth
