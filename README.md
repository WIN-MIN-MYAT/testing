# SustainWorld: Guardians of the Enchanted Wilds

This project is a Fantasy Adventures RPG-themed gamified sustainability task tracker.

To enjoy this RPG, you need the user id from Section A with more than zero point. Hence, firstly you need to finish some tasks from Section A and then you can start playing this RPG.
## Game Play
Since there are a couple of validators or filters, you need to go steps by steps in this RPG.

What I mean is when u startly create your new character, all your character has is ***level 1 and a starter item: A normal sword which offers very low stats***.

Each quest has their own level requirement to be completed so **You can't just directly go fight a final bosss or high-level quest**.

You need to finish easier quests first to earn levels to unlock quest and after every quest, u will receive a unique item as reward which offer different stats (Example: an item offers 450 hp and 715 dmg which will be added to your character).

The result of a fight with a creature depends on hp and dmg of your character. So grind and earn levels and items first.
### Items need to be equipped to apply the stats to your character after receiving as rewards

Here's the gudiline for your gameplay.
* Create Character
* Finish the easiest quest
* Equip the item you earned as reward
* Finish the other quest and equip reward items
* Slain the final boss and save the earth
